# Check the stock price!

In this repository you can find a file named ```main.py``` that queries the FMP on-line service to receive the stock value of well-known companies in U.S. Dollars. 

If you run the program, executing the main file with: ```python main.py AAPL -u test -p test``` it will  give you results similar to the following: 

```
$ python main.py AAPL -u test -p test
Apple Inc. (Symbol: AAPL) has a stock value of 270.27 $.
```

[FMP](https://financialmodelingprep.com/) is an on-line resource that provides stock data. The APIs are documented in a [API documentation page](https://financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs/). Note also that ```python2``` will give you a warning on a library, so you most likely want to run the program with: 

```$ python3 main.py```
